# Chapter 4: Data Architecture

# 1. Introduction
+ Architecture
  - Art and science of building things
  - Results of the process of building
+ Architecture
  - a description of current state of systems
  - the components of a set of systems
  - the disciplines of designing systems(architecuture practice)
    + different levels
    + different areas of focus
  - the intentional design of a system or a set of systems(future state or proposes architeture)
  - the artifacts that describe a system(architecture documentation)
    + describe existing state
    + define data requrements
    + guide data integration
    + control data asset
  - the team that does the design work (the Architects or the Architecture team)
+ Data Architecture is fundamental to Data Management
  - it is necessary to represent organizational data at different levels of abstraction so that it could be understood and managed
    + abstractions that include standards that govern how data is collected, stored, arraged, used, and removed.
    + descriptions of all the containers and paths that data takes through an organization's system
    
+ formal enterprise data model
  - the most detailed Data Architecuture design document
  - contains
    + data names
    + comprehensive data
    + metadata definitions
    + conceptual and logical entities and relationships
    + business rules

## 1.1 Business Drivers
+ Data Architecture is to be a bridge between business strategy and technology execution
  - Strategically prepare organizations to quick evlove their products, services, and data to take advantage of business oppotunities inherent in emerging technologies.
  - Translate business needs into data and system requirements so that processes consistently have the data they require
  - Manage complex data and information delivery throughout the enterprise
  - Facilitate alignment between Business and IT
  - Act as agents for changeï¼Œ transformatin, and agility.

## 1.2 Data Architecture Outcomes and Practices
### Outcomes
+ Data storage and processing requrements
+ Designs of structures and plans that meet the current and long-term data requirements of the enterprise
### Specifications
+ Define the current state of data in the organization
+ Provide a standard business vocabulary for data and compoents
+ Align Data Architecture with enterprise strategy and business architecture
+ Express strategic data requirements
+ Ooutline high-level integrated designs to meet these requirements
+ Integrate with overall enterprise architecture raodmap
### Practices
+ Using Data Architecture artifacts(master blueprints) to define data requirements, guide data integration, control data assets, and align data investments with business strategy.
+ Collabrating with, learning from and influencing various stakeholders that are engaged with improving the business or IT systems development
+ Using Data Architecture to establish the semantics of an enterprise, via a common business strategy.

## 1.3 Essential Concepts
### 1.3.1 Enterprise Architecture Domains
+ Data Architecture operates in context of other architecture domains.
+ Architects from different domains must addres development directions and requirements collaboratively.

|Domain|Enterprise Business Architecture|Enterprise Data Architeture|Enterprise Application Architecture|Enterprise Technoligy Architecture|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|Purpose|To identify how an enterprise creates value for customers and other stakeholders|To describe how data should be organizaed and managed|To describe the structure and functionality of applications in an enterprise|To describe the physical technology needed to enable systems to function and deliver value|
|Elements|Business models, processes, capabilities, services, events, strategies, vocabulary|Data models, data definitions, data mapping specifications, data flows, structured data APIs|Business systems, software packages, databases|Technical platforms, networks, security, integration tools|
|Dependencies|Establish requirements for the other domains|Manage data created and required by business architecture|Acts on specified data according to business requirements|Hosts and executes the application architecture|
|Roles|Business architects and analysts, business data stewards|Data Architect and modelers, data stewards|Applications architects|Infrastructure architects|

### 1.3.2 Enterprise Architecture Frameworks
+ is "architecture of architecture"
+ Zachman framework for enterprise architecture
