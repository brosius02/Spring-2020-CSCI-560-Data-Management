# Chapter 4: Data Architecture

# 1. Introduction
+ Architecture
  - Art and science of building things
  - Results of the process of building
+ Architecture
  - a description of **current state** of systems
  - the **components** of a set of systems
  - the **disciplines of designing systems(architecuture practice)**
    + different levels
    + different areas of focus
  - the intentional design of a system or a set of systems(**future state or proposes architeture**)
  - the **artifacts** that describe a system(architecture documentation)
    + describe existing state
    + define data requirements
    + guide data integration
    + control data asset
  - the team that does the design work (the Architects or the Architecture team)
+ Data Architecture is fundamental to Data Management
  - it is necessary to represent organizational data at different levels of abstraction so that it could be understood and managed
    + abstractions that include standards that govern how data is collected, stored, arraged, used, and removed.
    + descriptions of all the containers and paths that data takes through an organization's system
    
+ formal enterprise data model
  - the most detailed Data Architecuture design document
  - contains
    + data names
    + comprehensive data
    + metadata definitions
    + conceptual and logical entities and relationships
    + business rules

## 1.1 Business Drivers
+ Data Architecture is to be a bridge between business strategy and technology execution
  - Strategically prepare organizations to quick evlove their products, services, and data to take advantage of business oppotunities inherent in emerging technologies.
  - Translate business needs into data and system requirements so that processes consistently have the data they require
  - Manage complex data and information delivery throughout the enterprise
  - Facilitate alignment between Business and IT
  - Act as agents for changeï¼Œ transformatin, and agility.

## 1.2 Data Architecture Outcomes and Practices
### Outcomes
+ Data storage and processing requrements
+ Designs of structures and plans that meet the current and long-term data requirements of the enterprise
### Specifications
+ Define the current state of data in the organization
+ Provide a standard business vocabulary for data and compoents
+ Align Data Architecture with enterprise strategy and business architecture
+ Express strategic data requirements
+ Ooutline high-level integrated designs to meet these requirements
+ Integrate with overall enterprise architecture raodmap
### Practices
+ Using Data Architecture artifacts(master blueprints) to define data requirements, guide data integration, control data assets, and align data investments with business strategy.
+ Collabrating with, learning from and influencing various stakeholders that are engaged with improving the business or IT systems development
+ Using Data Architecture to establish the semantics of an enterprise, via a common business strategy.

## 1.3 Essential Concepts
### 1.3.1 Enterprise Architecture Domains
+ Data Architecture operates in context of other architecture domains.
+ Architects from different domains must addres development directions and requirements collaboratively.

|Domain|Enterprise Business Architecture|Enterprise Data Architeture|Enterprise Application Architecture|Enterprise Technoligy Architecture|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|Purpose|To identify how an enterprise creates value for customers and other stakeholders|To describe how data should be organizaed and managed|To describe the structure and functionality of applications in an enterprise|To describe the physical technology needed to enable systems to function and deliver value|
|Elements|Business models, processes, capabilities, services, events, strategies, vocabulary|Data models, data definitions, data mapping specifications, data flows, structured data APIs|Business systems, software packages, databases|Technical platforms, networks, security, integration tools|
|Dependencies|Establish requirements for the other domains|Manage data created and required by business architecture|Acts on specified data according to business requirements|Hosts and executes the application architecture|
|Roles|Business architects and analysts, business data stewards|Data Architect and modelers, data stewards|Applications architects|Infrastructure architects|

### 1.3.2 Enterprise Architecture Frameworks
+ is "architecture of architecture"
+ Zachman framework for enterprise architecture
  - is an ontology
  - does not define how to create a model, simply shows what model should exist
  - columns: **communication interrogatives** 
    + What: entities used to build the architecture
    + How: activities performed
    + Where: business location and technology location
    + Who: Roles and organizations
    + When: Intervals, events, cycles, and schedules
    + Why: Goals, strategies, and means
  - rows: **reification transformations**
    + executive perspective(business context): List of business elements defining scope in identification models
    + business management perspective(business concepts): Clarification of the relationships between business concepts defined by Executive Leaders as Owners in definition models
    + architect perspective(business ligic): System logical models detailing system requirements and unconstrained design represented by Architects as Designers in representation models.
    + engineer perspective(business physics): Physical models optimizing the design for implementation for specific use under the constraints of specific technology, people, costs, and timeframes specified by Engineers as Builders in specification models.
    + technician perspective(component assemblies): A technology-specific, out-of-context view of how components are assembled and operate configured by Technicians as Implementers in configuration models.
    + user perspective(operation classes): Actual functioning instances used by Workers as Participants. There are no models in this perspective.
  - each cell represents a unique type of design artifact.

### 1.3.3 Enterprise Data Architecture
+ Enterprise Data Model(EDM)
+ Data Flow Design

#### Enterprise Data Model(EDM)
+  is composed of data models from different perspectives and at different levels of details
+ describe data entities, data attributes, and their realationships across the enterprise.
+ includes both universal(conceptual and logical models) and application- or project-specific data models
+ mostly is built increamentally and iteratively.

![23](../Resources/figure23.png)

+ vertical: models in each level maps to models in other levels
+ horizontal: entities and relationships may appear in multiple models in the same level.


![24](../Resources/figure24.jpg)

+ Each Subject Area Diagram contains a conceptual data model with a set of entities.
+ Relationships may cross Subject Area borders
+ Each entity in an EDM should reside in only one Subject Area, but can be related to entities in any other Subject Area.

+ Subject Area discriminator principles:
  - **normalization rules**
  - dividng Subject Area from system portfolios (funding)
  - forming Subject Area from data governance structure and data ownership(organizational)
  - using top-level processes (based on the business value chairs)
  - using business capabilities(enterprise architecture-based)
 
#### Data Flow Design
+ Data flows map and document relationships between data and
  - Applications within a business process
  - Data stores or databases in an enviroment
  - Network segments (useful for security mapping)
  - Business roles, depicting which roles have responsibility for creating, updating, using, and deleting data (CRUD:create, read, update, and delete)
  - Locations where local difference occur

+ Data flows can be represented by two-dimensional matrices
![25](../Resources/figure25.png)

+ Data flows can also be represented by data flow diagram.
  - data flow between systems

# 2. Activities
+ Quality-oriented
  - focus on improving execution within business and IT development cycles.
+ Innovation-oriented
  - focus on tranforming business and IT to address new expecatations and opportunities.
## 2.1 Establish Data Architecture Practices
+ An Data Architecture practice generally includes the following work streams:
  - Strategy
    + select frameworks
    + state approaches
    + develop roadmap
  - Acceptance and culture
    + inform and motivate changes in behavior
  - Organization
    + Organize Data Architecture work by assigning accoutabilities and responsibilities
  - Working methods
    + Define best practice and perform Data Architecture work within developement projects, in coordination with Enterprise Architecture
  - Results
    + Produce Data Architecture artifacts within an overall raodmap
+ Data Architecture infuences the scope boudaries of projects and system release:
  - Defining project data requirements
  - Reviewing project data designs
  - Determing data lineage impact
  - Data replication control
  - Enforcing Data Architecture standards
  - Guide data technolog and renewal decisions

### 2.1.1 Evaluate Existing Data Architecture Specifications

### 2.1.2 Develop a roadmap
+ A roadmap  manages data dependencies and make forward-looking decisions.
+ A roadmap helps an organization see trade-offs and formulate a pragmatic plan, aligned with business needs and opportunities, external requirements, and available resources.
+ A roadmap describes the architecture's 3-5 year development path.
+ A roadmap describes how the target will become reality, together with the business requirements, consideration of actual conditions, and the technical assessments.

![27](../Resources/figure27.png)

+ A business-data-driven roadmap starts with the business capabilities that are most independent.
+ A business-data-driven roadmap ends with the business capabilities that are most dependent.
+ In the example above, the roadmap would ideally advise starting at Product Management and Customer Management capabilities and then resolve each dependency in steps from top to bottom.

### 2.1.3 Manage Enterprise Requirements within Projects
+ Data Architecture should determine
  - whether enterprise-wide entities represented in the specificaiton conform to agreed-uopn standards
  - what entities in the requirements specification should be included in the overall Enterprise Data Architecture
  - whether entities and definitions in this specification need to be generalized or improved upon to handle future trends
  - whether new data delivery architecturees are indicated or whether to pointthe developers in the direction of reuse

+ **Data Architecture project-related activities include**
  - Define scope
  - Understand business requirement
  - Design
  - Implement
    + When buying
    + When reusing data
    + When building
+ Methodologies of the process of building architetural activities into projects
  - Waterfall methods
  - Incremental methods
  - Agile, iterative methods
## 2.2 Integrate with Enterprise Architecture
+ Funded projects generally drive architectural priorities.'
+ Data Architecture may influence the scope of projects.
+ It is best, therefore, to integrate Data Architecture with Enterprise Architecture.

+ a clear and consistent line direction
+ a consistent line cross display method
+ consistent object attributes
  - sizes, colors, line thickness, etc.
+ linear symmetry

# 5. Implementation Guideline
A Data Architecture implementation should include at least two of the followings as they benefit from being launched simultaneously, or at least as paralle activities.
+ Organizing the Enterprise Data Architecture teams and forus
+ Producing the initial versions of Data Architecture artifacts, such as enterprise data model, enterprise-wide data flow and road maps.
+ Forming adn establishing a data architectural way of working in development projects
+ Creating awareness throughout the organization of the value of Data Architecture efforts
## 5.1 Readiness Assessment / Risk Assessment
Architecture initiation projects expose more risks, such as:
+ Lack of management support
+ No proven record of accomplishment
+ Apprehensive sponsor
+ Counter-productive executive decisions
+ Culture shock
+ Inexperienced project leader
+ Dominance of a one-dimensional view
## 5.2 Organization and Cultrual Change
The ability of an organizatin to adopt Data Architecture practices depends on 
+ Cultrural receptivity to architectural approach(developing an architecture-friendly culture)
+ Organizational recognition of data as a business asset, not just an IT concern
+ Organizational ability to let go of a local perspective and adopt an enterprise perspective on data
+ Organizational ability to integrate architectural deliverables into project methodoglogy
+ Level of acceptance of formal data governace
+ Ability to look holistially at the enterprise, rather than being focused solely on project delivery and IT solutioning

# 6. Data Architecture Governance
Data Architecture and Data Governance have to be well aligned. Data Architecture governace activities include:
+ Overseeing Projects
+ Managing architectural designs, lifecycle, and tools
+ Defining standards
+ Creating data-related artifacts
