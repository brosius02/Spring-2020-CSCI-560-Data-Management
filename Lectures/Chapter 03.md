  ## 1.1 Business Drivers
 + Reducing Risk
  - General risk management
    + risks to finances or reputation, including response to legal and regulatory issues.
  - Data security
  - Privacy
 + Improving Processes
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Data quality improvement
  - Metadata management
  - Efficieny in development projects
  - Vendor management
    + control of contracts dealing with data
  
  ## 1.2 Goals and Principles
  ### Goals
  + The overall goal of DG is to enable an organization to manage data as an asset.
  + To achieve it, a DG program must be
    - Sustainable: DG necessirates changes in how data is managed and used.
    - Embedded: DG activities need to be incorporated into development methods for softwares, use of data for analytics, mangement of Master Data, and risk management.
    - Measured
  ## Principles
  + Leadership and strategy
    + DG starts with leadership
    + DG is guided by a data strategy(data strategy is driven by the enterprise business strategy)
  + Business-driven
  + Shared responsibility
    - DG must govern IT decisions related to data
  + Multi-layered
    - local layer
    - enterprise layer
    - often in-between
  + Framework-based
    - establish an operating framework for coordination across functional areas
  + Principle-based
  
  ## 1.3 Enssential Concepts
  + DG ensures data is properly used without directly executing data management.
  + DG represents an inherent separation of duty between oversight and execution.

  ### 1.3.1 Data-centric Organization
  + Data should be managed as a corporate asset.
  + Data management best practices should incented across the organization
  + Enterprise data strategy must be directly aligned with overall business strategy.
  + Data management processes should be continuously improved.
  ### 1.3.2 Data Governance Organization
  + Each organization should 
    - adopt a **governance model**.
    - be prepared to envolve the model to meet new challenges.
    
  + Generic data governance model
    - activities at different levels within the  organization (vertical axis)
    - separtion of governance responsibilities within the organizational functions and between IT and business areas.

  + typical Data Governance Committees/Bodies

Consists of a cross-functional group of senior executives. <br> Typically releases funding for data governance and data governance-sponsored activites as recommended by the DGC and CDO. This committee may in turn have oversight from higher-level funding or initiative-based steering committees.|
  |Data Governance Council(DGC)|Manages data governance initiatives, issues, and escalations. Consists of executive according to the operating model used.|
  |Data Governance Office(DGO)|Ongoing focus on enterprise-level data definitions and data management standards across all DAMA-DMBOK Knowledge Areas. Consists of coordinating roles that are labelled as data stewards or custodians, and data owners.|
  |Data Stewardship Teams| Communities of interess focused on one or more specific subject-areas or projects, collaborating or consulting with project teams on data definitions and data management standards related to the focus. Consists of business and technical data stewards and data analysts.|
