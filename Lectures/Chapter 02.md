## Summary
+ Many organizations fail to recognize and respond to the ethical obligations inherent in data management.
+ The data enviroment is evolving rapidly. While laws codify some ethical principles, legislation cannot keep up with the risks assocaited with evoluton of the data enviroment.




# 2. Business Drivers
+ An ethical approach to data use is increasingly being recognized as a competive business advantage.  Ethical data handling can 
  - increase the trustworthiness of an organization and the organization's data and process outcomes,
  - create better relationships between the organization and its stakeholders,
  - reduce the risk that data for which the organization is responsible will be misused by employees, customers, or partners,
  - secure data from criminals(Chapter 7)
  - adapt to the influence of  different modles of data ownership, and the emerging roles of Chief Data Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chierf Privacy Officer, and Chief Analytics Officer.

### 3.4.5 Transforming and Integrating Data
+ Data integration presents ethical challenge because data is changed as it moves from system to system. which may present risks:
  - Limited knowledge of data's origin and lineage
  - Data of poor quality
  - Unreliable metadata
  - No documentatoin of data remediation history
